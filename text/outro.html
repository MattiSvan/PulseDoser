    <h3>⚠️ Important Notes:</h3>
    These settings serve as general guidelines and may not be optimal for all installations.
    Several factors can influence the appropriate configuration, including feed pellet size,
    length and layout of the feed lines, fish size, appetite, and more. It is important to adjust
    and calibrate the system according to the specific conditions and operational needs of
    each site.<br>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Low Motor Speed:</b><br> Reduces the cooler fan speed, increasing the risk of overheating (OLF fault) if feeding at high rates.</li>
        <li><b>High Rates + Low Speed:</b><br> Results in low OFF time and higher overheating risk.</li>
        <li><b>Change the funnel. 1000 g/s:</b><br> It provides a calibration that is half the size, ensures more even feeding, and results in a stronger engine (with a lower risk of OLF fault).</li>
        <li><b>Routine Maintenance:</b><br> Perform regular inspections of the doser unit. Open the top cover and vacuum out the upper compartment to prevent feed buildup, which could affect calibration accuracy.</li>
        <li><b>Long-Term Line Shutdown:</b><br> When a feed line is taken out of operation for an extended period, it is recommended to close the silo outlet and blow all remaining feed out of the doser. This helps prevent blockages and ensures accurate dosing when the line is reactivated.</li>
    </ul>
